# Eyes

The Eyes coding project features an eyeball in the middle of the page.  As you move your mouse around the page, the pupil in the center of the eye moves towards that direction.  This makes it seem as if the eye is watching wherever you put your mouse.

## How to Run

To run this exercise simply open up the page. You do not need to do anything to activate the eye.  Move your mouse around the page and notice how the eye is tracking the movement of your mouse!

## Future Improvements

There are a few different things that could be done with this code in the future to give it different variations.  One thing would be to add another eye that also tracks the movement of the mouse.  Another feature that could make it more realistic would be to have the eyeball blink every few seconds. Other possible features could make it possible to change the eye and background color.
